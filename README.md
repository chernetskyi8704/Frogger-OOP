# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## Project Overview

I was provided with visual resources and a game loop engine; using these tools, I had to add several entities to the game, including player characters and enemies, to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

## What did the project give me?

It was a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming and write designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects.
